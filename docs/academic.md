# Academic & Research Project Files

Files specifically relevant for academic, research, and scholarly projects.

## CITATION

Instructions for citing the project in academic work. **Essential for research software.**

### Required Contents
- Preferred citation format (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.)
- BibTeX entry
- DOI (Digital Object Identifier) if available
- Version to cite
- Complete author list with affiliations
- Publication details if applicable
- Year of release
- Project URL
- Alternative citation formats

### DOI Acquisition
- Zenodo provides free DOI for GitHub projects
- Figshare is another DOI provider
- Archive releases for permanent citability
- Link DOI to specific versions

### Naming Variants
- `CITATION.md`
- `CITATION`
- `CITATION.cff` (Citation File Format - machine-readable, recommended)
- `REFERENCES.md`
- `REFERENCES`

### Citation File Format (CFF)
Modern machine-readable standard recognized by GitHub and other platforms. Contains structured metadata for automated citation generation.

### Platform Integration
GitHub recognizes `CITATION.cff` and provides a "Cite this repository" widget.

## ADOPTERS

### Required Contents
- Names of organizations or projects
- Optional: company/organization logos
- Use cases or application areas
- Optional: testimonials or quotes
- Contact information for featured adopters
- Categorization by industry or use case
- Scale of deployment (if permitted to disclose)

### When to Include
- Projects used in production by others
- Infrastructure or framework projects
- Tools with notable users
- Not recommended for early-stage projects without adopters

### Purpose
- Demonstrates real-world impact
- Builds trust with potential users
- Useful for grant applications and funding
- Shows project maturity

### Naming Variants
- `ADOPTERS.md`
- `ADOPTERS`
- `USERS.md`
- `USERS`

- `SHOWCASE`
- `PROJECTS.md`

## MANIFESTO

Vision and principles of the project. **For projects with strong philosophical positions.**

### Required Contents
- Project philosophy and core values
- Design principles and rationale
- What the project is and is not
- Long-term vision and goals

## Academic Best Practices

1. **Always include CITATION** - Make it easy to cite your work properly
2. **Get a DOI** - Use Zenodo for permanent archival and citability
3. **Use Citation File Format** - GitHub/GitLab recognize `CITATION.cff`
4. **Update ADOPTERS** - Shows real-world impact (valuable for grants)
5. **Link to papers** - Reference any publications about the project
6. **Version your releases** - Use semantic versioning for reproducibility
7. **Archive major versions** - Ensures reproducibility of research
8. **Document methodology** - Explain algorithms and approaches
9. **Provide benchmarks** - Include performance metrics and comparisons
10. **Link datasets** - Reference or describe datasets used

## Integration with Academia

### Recommended Additional Elements
- Papers directory for publications
- Benchmarks directory for performance data
- Data directory or links to datasets
- Reproducibility documentation
- Algorithm documentation
- Validation and verification procedures
- Comparison with existing methods

### Grant and Funding Considerations
- ADOPTERS file strengthens funding applications
- CITATION makes academic credit clear
- Documentation of impact and adoption
- Evidence of community and sustainability
